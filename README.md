Laravel MongoDB
===============

This package adds functionalities to the Eloquent model and Query builder for MongoDB, using the original LaraGram API.
*This library extends the original LaraGram classes, so it uses exactly the same methods.*

It is compatible with LaraGram 3.x.

> [!NOTE]
> This package has been completely rewritten from the official [mongodb/laravel-mongodb](https://github.com/mongodb/laravel-mongodb]) version.
